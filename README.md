# Airbnb Lisbon Dashboard: Prices, Availability, Listings

---

## Project Description

This project analyzes Airbnb listings in **Lisbon** to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and host behavior.  
The project includes SQL-based data exploration, cleaning, aggregation, and an interactive **Tableau dashboard**.

ðŸ”— [Tableau Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Airbnb_Lisbon_Analysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   â†’ Check structure, null values, outliers, duplicates

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   â†’ Fix `room_type`, remove irrelevant categories  
   â†’ Replace NULLs, remove records with missing key values

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   â†’ Create buckets for host size, length of stay, availability score

4. **SQL Aggregation**  
   â†’ Summarize data by neighbourhood, host group, room type

5. **Data Visualization**  
   â†’ Build charts in Tableau dashboard

## Key Findings

- **Entire home/apt** is the most popular type of listing, dominating the market share across Lisbon.
- **Listing prices vary significantly** across neighbourhoods. Premium areas such as *Colares* and *AlcÃ¢ntara* show the highest average prices, while others appear underpriced and underutilized.
- **Hosts with more listings** tend to charge higher prices, suggesting they operate more like small businesses.
- **Availability is generally high** â€” listings are open ~170â€“200 days/year, which may reflect Lisbon's long tourist season or host strategies for consistent income.
- **User activity (reviews)** is higher for *Private rooms* and *Entire homes*, indicating stronger guest engagement or demand in these categories.

### Business Recommendations

- **Segment hosts by listing volume**:
  - *Individual hosts*: Provide onboarding support, templates, and education to help them grow.
  - *Professional hosts*: Offer loyalty programs and pricing optimization tools.

- **Regional marketing strategies**:
  - Highlight undervalued areas with high availability and competitive pricing.
  - Redirect user demand from saturated or expensive areas to more affordable, underbooked neighborhoods.

- **Enhance the user experience**:
  - Surface more availability and review insights within listing pages to improve booking confidence.
  - Improve the categorization of room types. Irrelevant or inconsistent types were grouped as `"Other"` and should ideally be cleaned or eliminated in the data pipeline.
